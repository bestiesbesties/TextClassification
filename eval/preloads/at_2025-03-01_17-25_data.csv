for tutoring. also there are some set of rules for dropping the tutoring sessions which are incorporated in this project. the other piece of this project is automated emails through scheduled task which runs every day. responsibilities created a availability calendar grid. in grid each cell represents time hour span and day of the week. clicking on the cell toggles the availability. automatically populated the course schedule which comes from different databaseworked with data warehouse team in order to get that data developed c console application for scheduled email task. got rid of data tables and table adapters in the main project as they are tightly coupled. created class libraries out of the main project to access the database which can be used by both console application for schedule task and web application. integrated open source html text editor ckeditor into the website. used jquery for filtering sorting and search the listview javascript for
